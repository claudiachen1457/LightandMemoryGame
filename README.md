Submitted by: Claudia Chen

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [X] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [X] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [X] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [X] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
One difficult challenge was getting the image to pop up in the background. I looked over the glitch website's resources and learned about 
how all imported files have their own URL that you can utilize. When directly using the img function, I saw that only the alternative title 
was appearing. That troubleshooting process took a while since I was looking at the wrong issue of thinking that I didnâ€™t implement the button 
pressing correctly and went down the wrong path to fix the issue. Another problem was that I originally found myself jumping from file to file
without knowing what I was looking for, but this process of figuring out where to implement something helped me a lot with learning the 
specific functions of HTML, Javascript, and CSS. Coding ultimately requires a delicate eye and a lot of research on the specific syntax for a
language, so I had to take advantage of those facts in order to successfully implement everything. I really appreciate the online coding 
community and how much people are willing to help with certain issues; these kind strangers allowed me to spot certain mistakes that I was 
making and how I can better implement something. 


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Doing this project has made me very appreciative of all the effort that goes into web development. Something that I would like to learn more 
about is how to position everything where you want. Is this something you have to go through trial and error for, or is there a way to get 
coordinates for the specific location on a webpage where you want a feature to be located? I am also very curious about the debugging process 
and how you go about making sure that nothing is easily hackable or breakable. Do combining these different programming languages help the 
software to be more secure? 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had more time, I would love to try out more stylistic options and learn how to implement different audio clips. I was able to implement 
adding an image to the buttons, but I found it difficult to use the same methods to add a new audio clip. Also, it would be very worthwhile to 
make the message for winning a lot more eye-catching and exciting. There could be confetti, trumpet noises and the buttons could move around 
if the player won. There are so many potential additional features, only limited by creativity, which is why web development is so interesting 
to me.
